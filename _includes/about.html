                  <p>Women In Tech's mission is to inspire talented women to consider a future in media and technology by providing the network and experience of successful women and men from the corporate and entrepreneurial worlds.</p>
                  <p>To do so, we hold an annual event so that members can network, inspire one another and stay motivated.  The first Women in Tech event took place on the International Womens’ Day 2014 in Stockholm.</p>

                  <p>In fall 2014, we invited WIT:s to attend WIT@Sime – a unique industry collaboration between MTGx, Google, Spotify, Microsoft, Samsung, Tele2, TeliaSonera, Bonnier, Schibsted and Sime. The interest for the event was huge, and we are very much looking forward to providing with even more such opportunities in 2015, making it an even more successful WIT year.</p>
