                  <p>Diversity is an issue within many facets of life. Women In Technology (WIT) believes that we can do something to change the lack of gender diversity in the media and technology industries. The organization brings together key influencers, community members, entrepeneurs and thought-provokers.</p>
                  <h4>The Mission:</h4>
                  <p>To inspire talented women to consider a future in media and technology by providing the network and experience of successful women and men from the corporate and entrepreneurial worlds.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                  <p>To do so, WIT holds an annual event so that members can network, inspire one another and stay motivated.  The first Women in Tech event took place on the International Womensâ€™ Day 2014 in Stockholm.</p>
                  <p>For the last two years the event has provided a unique industry collaboration between MTGx, Google, Spotify, Microsoft, Samsung, Tele2, TeliaSonera, Bonnier, Schibsted and Sime. The interest for the event is growing exponentially each year.  This year, we have over 6,000 participants interested in attending the WIT 2016 conference. We welcome all!</p>
